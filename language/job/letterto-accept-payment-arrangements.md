Dear [recipient's name]:
I have received your letter dated 8/7/10 regarding my account number 328929 with your company. That letter detailed a proposed payment arrangement of $15 per month for the next 6 months, until my balance of $90 is paid in full.
I am writing to inform you that I accept this payment arrangement and will make the payments according to this agreement. If at all possible, I will pay off the full balance sooner.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
[Signature]
