https://www.thebalance.com/job-offer-acceptance-letter-2062550

It is always a good idea to accept a job offer via letter. A job acceptance letter allows you to demonstrate your professionalism and make sure there is no confusion about the precise terms of the offer, such as vacation time or benefits. It's also is an opportunity to express your gratitude for being offered a position, as well as your enthusiasm for taking on the new role. 

Below is advice on how to write a letter accepting a job offer, as well as sample acceptance letters.


Use these sample letters as a guideline when you write your own letter. Just make sure to tailor the specifics of the letter to your own offer. 

What to Include in a Job Offer Acceptance Letter
Your letter can be brief, but should include the following:

Thank you and appreciation for the opportunity
Written acceptance of the job offer
The terms and conditions of employment (salary, benefits, job title, etc.)
Starting date of employment
The letter can be sent by email or mail. If you're sending a hard copy through the mail, format the letter as you would any business letter. Include your contact information and phone number, even though it is on file with the employer.

When sending an email letter, put your name in the subject line (Your Name - Job Offer Acceptance). This helps ensure that your message will be opened and read.

No matter which way you send the letter, make sure to address the letter to the person who offered you the position.

Advice on Writing a Job Offer Acceptance Letter
Keep it brief.  While you want to include all the most important information, this does not mean your letter should be long. The employer is busy, so a concise letter that includes all the necessary information is best.

Express your gratitude. Demonstrate how thankful you are for the opportunity.


You might want to refer to why you are particularly excited to work for the company, such as your desire to contribute to their sales team, or your passion for their mission. Again, keep this polite but brief. 

Edit, edit, edit. Before you send your letter, be sure to thoroughly proofread the letter. You do not want to create any last-minute reasons for the employer to take back the job offer, such as a sloppy or unprofessional letter.
