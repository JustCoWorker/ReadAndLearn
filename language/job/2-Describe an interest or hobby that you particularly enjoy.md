IELTS Cue Card Sample 77 - Describe an interest or hobby that you particularly enjoy https://www.ielts-mentor.com/cue-card-sample/696-ielts-cue-card-sample-77-describe-an-interest-or-hobby-that-you-particularly-enjoy

Model Answer 1:
Today I am going to talk about a hobby I particularly enjoy when I am at home in the UK. I will tell you what the hobby is; how long I have been doing it; who I do it with and why it is important to me.

My hobby is running!  I know I do not really look like a runner, and it is true I am not very fast, but this is still the activity that I like to do in my spare time.

I have not been running for very long.  I started running just 18 months ago, as I decided I needed to get fit, and I thought it would be a cheap way to exercise.  I did not expect to enjoy myself. Near to where I live, there is a park.  It is very beautiful with trees and streams.  Each Saturday a large group of about 500 people meet at 9.00 a.m. in the morning and go for a 5 km run together. This event is called Parkrun, and it happens in over 300 different places in the UK each week. I was nervous when I first went but found the group was friendly and encouraging.  Now I go every week, and I even have trained for some longer races 10 km and my longest was 20 k.m.!

I have made lots of friends through running.  However, the best surprise was that when I went to my local Parkrun, I met someone I had not seen for over 30 years!  We had been at school together but did not keep in touch.  We had both moved to the new city of Sheffield and did not realise we lived so close to each other.  Now I run with this friend every week, and we go for breakfast each Saturday after our run.

Running is important to me because it keeps me fit, has helped me make new friends, and it has shown me that I am not too old to try new things!  I hope you all find activities that you enjoy doing in your spare time!

Model Answer 2:
Blogging is the interest or hobby that I really enjoy and have been doing it very passionately for the last 2-3 years. A blog is basically the short form of 'weblog' and it lets the blogger write on topics he/she likes. It is very similar to a website and the blog posts I write is open for anyone to read using the internet. This blog is not collaborated with anyone at the moment. Currently, I am updating it alone but I have a plan to share this with some of my friends who also has interests in writing and blogging.
 
The blog I am maintaining has lots of importance both for me and for the intended readers. For me, the blog helps me improving my writing skill as it requires lots of content writing, helps me exploring of relevant topics that improve my knowledge and to upload the images I take with my camera. Sometimes I write on how-to and tutorials which are helpful for people looking for it. Sometimes I write on books I read, movies I watch or about new things I learn and that helps me observing those in a different perspective. People can comment on the articles I add and thus I have got many others in my blog who shares similar interests that I have. Thus the importance of my blog immense to me and I maintain my blog with utmost passion and fervour. 
 
For writing blog posts I need to explore different topics and thus this habit helps me increase my knowledge on different topics. 
 

Model Answer 3:
Today I am going to talk about an activity that I do in my spare time. I will explain what the hobby is; how long I have been doing it; who I do it with and why it is important to me.

I don’t think you will be able to guess what my hobby is because it is quite unusual! In my free time, I work at an Alpaca Farm! An alpaca is an animal that is kept for its fleece, they look a little bit like sheep but with a very long neck! They are related to camels and llamas which you may recognise more easily. They usually live in South America, but there is an Alpaca Farm near to me in Sheffield and I work there at weekends. Although it is called an Alpaca Farm, in fact, there are lots of different animals there: horses; goats; sheep; some ducks and hens and even some llamas.

Working with the alpacas and the other animals on the farm means I have to get there early in the morning. I help to feed the animals and clean up after them. Sometimes I have to drive a tractor to take hay and water out to the horses. Often there are visitors to the farm and I will give them a guided tour and introduce them to all the different animals. At some times of the year, I help with special jobs to care for them, such as giving injections to protect them from illnesses or trimming their toenails if they get too long. My favourite time of year to help is in the spring when baby Alpacas are born. New-born alpacas have to stand up very quickly and within hours are drinking milk from their mothers and running around – it is amazing to watch.

I work on the farm with the farm manager. He is a very kind and funny man. Although we might not seem to have much in common on the surface, we get on really well together. We laugh and talk all the time whilst we are getting the jobs done.

Although my hobby is unusual it is very important to me. My full-time job is in indoors in an office and a lot of the time I am sitting down, so at weekends I like to get outside into the countryside and do some physical work that is completely different. I love the animals, the fresh air and the exercise. I also really enjoy talking with the farm manager as he can tell great stories. In the winter though it can be very cold, and trudging through 3 foot of snow to feed the animals is really exhausting. On those days I am glad that working with the Alpacas is just a hobby, I can spend the rest of the week in the warm!
