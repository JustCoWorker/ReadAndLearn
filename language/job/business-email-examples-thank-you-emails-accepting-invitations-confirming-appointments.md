Things to Avoid in Writing Acceptance Emails in Business

Often times, it is better to just say yes or no to an invitation. If you are not sure, it may be better to simply decline an invitation. It is quite unprofessional to say things like:

I’m busy, but I suppose I can manage to come.
I don’t think I’m a good speaker

 Conclusion

It is good to send acceptances as soon as you can. If you fall short of time, apologize succinctly and continue with your letter. Also, acceptances should be brief and focused on the acceptance alone. Let your direct response (yes or no) be in the first line of your letter. Your enthusiasm in this kind of emails gives more impact to the email.
