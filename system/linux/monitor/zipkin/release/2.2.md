Zipkin 2.2 focuses on operations, allowing proxy-mounting the UI and bundles a Prometheus Grafana dashboard

@stepanv modified the zipkin UI such that it can work behind reverse proxies which choose a different path prefix than '/zipkin'. If you'd like to try zipkin under a different path, Stepan wrote docs showing how to setup apache http.

Previously, zipkin had both spring and prometheus metrics exporters. Through hard work from @abesto and @kristofa, we now have a comprehensive example setup including a Zipkin+Prometheus Grafana dashboard. To try it out, use our docker-compose example, which starts everything for you. Once that's done, you can start viewing the health of your tracing system, including how many messages are dropped.

Here's an example, which you'd see at http://192.168.99.100:3000/dashboard/db/zipkin-prometheus?refresh=5s&orgId=1&from=now-5m&to=now if using docker-machine:

Other notes

our docker JVM has been upgraded to 1.8.0_144 from 1.8.0_131
the zipkin-server no longer writes log messages about drop messages at warning level as it can fill up disk. Enable debug logging to see the cause of drops
elasticsearch storage will now drop on backlog as opposed to backing up, as the latter led to out-of-memory crashes under load surges.
