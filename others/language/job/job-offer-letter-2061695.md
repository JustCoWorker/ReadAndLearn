https://www.thebalance.com/job-offer-letter-2061695

A job offer is a formal offer of employment from a company. When a company makes a verbal job offer, the hiring manager will typically call the selected candidate to let them know that they are being offered the job.

Types of Job Offers
Companies may also make job offers via email or in writing, depending on company policy and how the company handles hiring.

If the offer is made via the phone or email, it will most likely be followed by a formal job offer letter which confirms the details of the offer of employment including some or all of the following: job description, salary, benefits, paid time-off, work schedule, reporting structure, etc.


The candidate may choose to accept the job offer and then will sign and return the letter as a formal acceptance of the position.

If the offer isn't for the compensation package that the applicant expected, he or she may decide to make a counter offer or decline the offer.

Accepting a Job Offer
Typically, the employee must sign and return the letter as a formal acceptance of the position.

When your receive the letter, you have several options: you can accept on the spot (but keep in mind, there's a lot to consider before accepting right away), you can take a short period of time (ideally, no more than a few business days) to respond, or you can negotiate the conditions of the employment terms. You may even be able to negotiate benefits and perks.

If you need time to evaluate the job offer before accepting, that's fine, but it is very important to let the company know you need time, rather than just waiting to respond. If you delay too long, the company may think you aren't interested and may pass the offer on to another candidate. 

Declining a Job Offer
If the job simply isn't a good fit, you can also turn down the job offer, but it's important to do this politely and professionally so you don't burn any bridges with the company. If you're on the fence about how to respond and not sure if you should turn down the job offer, or negotiate, here is some advice.
