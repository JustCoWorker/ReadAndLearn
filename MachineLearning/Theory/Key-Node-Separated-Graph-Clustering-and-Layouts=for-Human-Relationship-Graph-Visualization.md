Many real-world applications use graphs to model relations between entities. Common graph analysis tasks include understanding correlations between the entities’ connections and attributes and discovering key entities with many connections or particular attributes. For example, graph visualization can be useful for analyzing human relationships. People in social networks have connections (or friendships), and the relations between subsets of people might form complex subnetworks. Understanding of correlations between people’s connection structures and attributes, such as jobs, hometowns, and hobbies, may contribute to various social and business analytics. Also, discovering key people and analyzing their positions and roles in a network may help us understand how information spreads in social networks.
许多现实世界的应用程序使用图来模拟实体之间的关系。常见的图分析任务包括理解实体的连接和属性之间的关联，并发现具有许多连接或特定属性的关键实体。例如，图的可视化可以用于分析人际关系。在社交网络中有联系（或友谊）的人和群体之间人会形成复杂的关系网络。了解人们的联系结构和属性，如工作、家乡和爱好之间的相互关系，可能有助于各种社会和商业分析。此外，发现关键人物并分析他们在网络中的位置和角色，可以帮助我们了解信息如何在社交网络中传播。

Development of key-node conscious graph visualization techniques is therefore expected to be an important contribution in many academic and business felds. Moreover, many applications must take into account additional information, such as node attributes. In the case of human relationship graphs, where nodes correspond to people, we often need to take into account people’s preferences as node attributes. Their preferences can be converted to numeric values using analysis techniques such as natural language processing of the documents written by each person. Graph visualizations featuring key-node-identifcation that combines topology and attribute-based clustering is therefore useful for these applications. Also, this clustering will contribute to visible representation of the tight connections between key nodes and their adjacent clusters.
识别关键节点的图形可视化技术的发展有望在许多学术和商业领域做出重要贡献。此外，许多应用程序还考虑额外的信息，如节点属性。在人类关系图中，节点与人对应，我们经常需要将人们的偏好作为节点属性。将他们的喜好转换成数值，便于分析，比如，自然语言处理文件。具有识别关键节点的图形可视化技术，与拓扑结构和基于属性的聚类相结合，对这些应用程序很有用。此外，这种表现方式将有助于标识关键节点及其相邻集群之间的紧密程度。

This article presents a graph visualization technique that features graph clustering based on a combination of structural neighborhood and attribute similarity. The technique supposes that each node of the graph has a constant-sized feature vector representing its attributes. It calculates distances between pairs of nodes according to the similarity of feature vectors and the commonality of neighbor nodes, and it generates clusters of the nodes according to their distances. It then calculates the initial positions of clusters applying a graph layout algorithm and adjusts the positions using a triangular mesh-smoothing algorithm, in which the mesh is generated by connecting centers of clusters with a Delaunay triangulation algorithm. Finally, it calculates the positions of nodes in each of the clusters, applies an edge bundling technique to design the shapes of edges, and draws all the nodes and edges.
本文提出了一种基于结构邻域和属性相似度相结合的图形聚类可视化技术。该技术假定图的每个节点都有一个常量大小的特征向量来表示其属性。根据特征向量的相似度和相邻节点的相似度，计算节点对之间的距离，并根据节点的距离生成节点簇。然后利用图形布局算法计算簇的初始位置，并利用三角网格平滑算法调整簇的位置，其中网格由聚类中心与Delaunay三角剖分算法生成。最后，计算每个簇中节点的位置，应用边缘捆绑技术设计边缘的形状，绘制所有节点和边。


# Graph-Clustering Problem
Graph clustering partitions a graph’s node set into clusters (that is, disjoint node sets); the goal is to have many intracluster edges and a few intercluster edges. Graph clustering is useful for both visualization and various analytic purposes
图聚类将图中的节点划分成团（即不相交的节点集）；目标是有很多的团内部的边和较少团外部的边缘。图聚类对于可视化和各种分析目的都是有用的。

The most popular graph-clustering approach is to extract tightly connected subgroups of nodes. Many graph-clustering techniques using this approach are based on agglomerative-clustering algorithms. Various criteria exist for measuring the distances among graph nodes,including the similarity of feature value vectors in multidimensional Euclidean spaces, adjacency-based node similarity measurements, and measuring the number of paths between two nodes to determine the tightness of the connections.
最流行的图聚类算法是提取紧密关联的子群。许多图聚类技术的运用这一方法是基于聚类算法。测量节点的距离之间存在着不同的标准，包括在多维欧氏空间的特征值向量的相似性，相似性测量的基于邻接节点，测量两个节点之间的路径的数目来确定连接的密封性。


#Cluster Layout
The presented technique then generates a cluster graph, consisting of vertices corresponding to the clusters of nodes, and bundles corresponding to sets of edges connecting two nodes belonging to two different clusters. Bundles are weighted according to the number of edges.
然后，所呈现的技术生成一个集群图，其中包含对应于节点集群的顶点，以及对应于连接两个不同集群的两个节点的边集。包根据边的数量来加权

We denote the cluster graph as

CG = {V, B}
V = {v1, ...}
B = {b1, ...}
vi = {ni1, ...}
bi = {ei1, ...} , (5)

CG是群集图，V是顶点的集合，B是b边的集合。一个顶点$v_{i}$包含属于与vi对应的集群的一组节点$n_{ij}$，而一个包$b_{i}$由一组边缘$e_{ij}$组成，它们连接了属于同一对集群的节点的节点对。
